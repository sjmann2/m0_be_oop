# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- **After all the practice I had using everything I've learned in hashes, this felt much more manageable! I got stuck a couple of times but nothing that trying out and testing code couldn't help for the most part. Plus I had fun figuring out this code!**
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- **I am getting better at taking breaks and knowing when to step away from the screen.**
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
- **I am going to continue to practice these skills during the next few weeks to keep the concepts in the front of my mind and still have the structure of working on technical skills for chunks of the day.**
